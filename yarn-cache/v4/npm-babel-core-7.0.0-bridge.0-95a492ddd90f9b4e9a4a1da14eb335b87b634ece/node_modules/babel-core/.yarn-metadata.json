    "readme": "## babel-bridge\n\nThis repo holds what we're calling a \"bridge\" package that is meant to ease the\ntransition for libraries that use \"babel-core\" as a peer dependency for Babel 6.\n\nThe issue with Babel 7's transition to scopes is that if a package depends on\nBabel 6, they may want to add support for Babel 7 alongside. Because Babel 7\nwill be released as `@babel/core` instead of `babel-core`, maintainers have\nno way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"babel-core\": \"6.x\"\n}\n```\ncannot change to\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"@babel/core\": \"6.x\"\n}\n```\n\nwithout it being a breaking change.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo address this, we're releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do\n\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"babel-core\": \"6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge\"\n}\n```\n\nthen where users of this package would originally have done\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core\n```\n\nto install Babel 6, they could now do\n\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core\n```\n\nto install the bridge package, and install Babel 7's core.\n"
