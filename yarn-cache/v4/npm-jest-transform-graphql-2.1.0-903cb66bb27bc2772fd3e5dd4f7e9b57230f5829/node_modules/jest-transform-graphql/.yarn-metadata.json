    "readme": "# jest-transform-graphql\n\n[`graphql-tag` loader for Webpack](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/webpack.html) lets you keep GraphQL queries in separate files.\n\nThis lib makes those work in Jest.\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your package.json,\n```\n  \"jest\": {\n    \"transform\": {\n      \"\\\\.(gql|graphql)$\": \"jest-transform-graphql\",\n      \".*\": \"babel-jest\"\n    }\n```\n\n\nYou have to include the `.*` matcher because once you define the `transform` property, it overrides that default.\n\nFor more on configuring Jest mappers, see Jest's [Webpack tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-webpack.html).\n",
