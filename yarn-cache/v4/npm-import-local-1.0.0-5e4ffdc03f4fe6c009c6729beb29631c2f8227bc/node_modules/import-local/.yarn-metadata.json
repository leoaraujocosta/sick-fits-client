For example, [AVA](http://ava.li) and [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) uses this method.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install import-local\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst importLocal = require('import-local');\n\nif (importLocal(__filename)) {\n\tconsole.log('Using local version of this package');\n} else {\n\t// Code for both global and local version here…\n}\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n",
