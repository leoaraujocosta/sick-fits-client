It allows you to easily build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL. To get the most value out of `apollo-client`, you should use it with one of its view layer integrations.\n\nTo get started with the React integration, go to our [**React Apollo documentation website**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).\n\nApollo Client also has view layer integrations for [all the popular frontend frameworks](#learn-how-to-use-apollo-client-with-your-favorite-framework). For the best experience, make sure to use the view integration layer for your frontend framework of choice.\n\nApollo Client can be used in any JavaScript frontend where you want to use data from a GraphQL server. It's:\n\n1. **Incrementally adoptable**, so that you can drop it into an existing JavaScript app and start using GraphQL for just part of your UI.\n2. **Universally compatible**, so that Apollo works with any build setup, any GraphQL server, and any GraphQL schema.\n3. **Simple to get started with**, so you can start loading data right away and learn about advanced features later.\n4. **Inspectable and understandable**, so that you can have great developer tools to understand exactly what is happening in your app.\n5. **Built for interactive apps**, so your users can make changes and see them reflected in the UI immediately.\n6. **Small and flexible**, so you don't get stuff you don't need. The core is under 25kb compressed.\n7. **Community driven**, because Apollo is driven by the community and serves a variety of use cases. Everything is planned and developed in the open.\n\nGet started on the [home page](http://apollographql.com/client), which has great examples for a variety of frameworks.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# installing the preset package\nnpm install apollo-boost graphql-tag graphql --save\n# installing each piece independently\nnpm install apollo-client apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-link-http graphql-tag graphql --save\n```\n\nTo use this client in a web browser or mobile app, you'll need a build system capable of loading NPM packages on the client. Some common choices include Browserify, Webpack, and Meteor 1.3+.\n\nInstall the [Apollo Client Developer tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm) for a great GraphQL developer experience!\n\n## Usage\n\nYou get started by constructing an instance of the core class [`ApolloClient`][]. If you load `ApolloClient` from the [`apollo-boost`][] package, it will be configured with a few reasonable defaults such as our standard in-memory cache and a link to a GraphQL API at `/graphql`.\n\n```js\nimport ApolloClient from 'apollo-boost';\n\nconst client = new ApolloClient();\n```\n\n\nTo point `ApolloClient` at a different URL, add your GraphQL API's URL to the `uri` config property:\n\n```js\nimport ApolloClient from 'apollo-boost';\n\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\n  uri: 'https://graphql.example.com'\n});\n```\n\nMost of the time you'll hook up your client to a frontend integration. But if you'd like to directly execute a query with your client, you may now call the `client.query` method like this:\n\n```js\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nclient.query({\n  query: gql`\n    query TodoApp {\n      todos {\n        id\n        text\n        completed\n      }\n    }\n  `,\n})\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error(error));\n```\n\nNow your client will be primed with some data in its cache. You can continue to make queries, or you can get your `client` instance to perform all sorts of advanced tasks on your GraphQL data. Such as [reactively watching queries with `watchQuery`][], [changing data on your server with `mutate`][], or [reading a fragment from your local cache with `readFragment`][].\n\nTo learn more about all of the features available to you through the `apollo-client` package, be sure to read through the [**`apollo-client` API reference**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/apollo-client.html).\n\n[`ApolloClient`]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/apollo-client.html\n[`apollo-boost`]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/get-started.html#apollo-boost\n[reactively watching queries with `watchQuery`]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/apollo-client.html#ApolloClient.watchQuery\n[changing data on your server with `mutate`]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/mutations.html\n[reading a fragment from your local cache with `readFragment`]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/caching.html#direct\n\n## Learn how to use Apollo Client with your favorite framework\n\n- [React](http://apollographql.com/docs/react/)\n- [Angular](http://apollographql.com/docs/angular/)\n- [Vue](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo)\n- [Ember](https://github.com/bgentry/ember-apollo-client)\n- [Polymer](https://github.com/aruntk/polymer-apollo)\n- [Meteor](http://apollographql.com/docs/react/recipes/meteor.html)\n- [Blaze](http://github.com/Swydo/blaze-apollo)\n- [Vanilla JS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/apollo-client.html)\n- [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-apollo)\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-client)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apollographql/apollo-client/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/apollographql/apollo-client)\n\n[Read the Apollo Contributor Guidelines.](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nRunning tests locally:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\nThis project uses TypeScript for static typing and TSLint for linting.
